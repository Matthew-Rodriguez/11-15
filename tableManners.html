                            <p class="extra-text">Table Manners (2014-2016) is a video series that sees individuals in the Niger Delta giving an eating
                                performance for Zina’s camera. The viewer is encouraged to enter, sit down and enjoy the meal with
                                the eaters. All the performers in the series use their hands to eat. At the end of each film the place of
                                the filming is stated. This documentation simply serves to highlight that “an important ritual has
                                taken place”. Saro-Wiwa states: “A powerful exchange takes place when one not only eats a meal but
                                watches a meal being consumed. One is filled up with an unexplainable and potent metaphysical
                                energy that we normally pay no attention to.” This work places a spotlight on and radicalizes this
                                invisible force. The documentation of the meal and the place it was consumed forces the viewer to
                                also ingest the names and cultural realities surrounding the oil production in the Niger Delta.
                                Realities that are usually ignored or erased.
                                Although Table Manners’ provocative title speaks to colonially-instigated questions surrounding the
                                manner in which Africans traditionally eat, the piece is, for Saro-Wiwa, really about place and power.
                                The act of eating and consuming the food drawn from the land re-inscribes and re-insinuates the eater
                                back into the landscape in a physical and metaphysical way, rendering a quotidian action into an act of
                                defiance. The somewhat confrontational action speaks of agency, power, sexuality, ownership and
                                stewardship. The performance is sublimated ritual and resistance. An act of insistence which takes on
                                a particular resonance when considering the fractured relationship with the land that has been imposed
                                on Niger Delta peoples over the last 100 years.
                                The work has been shown at Blaffer Art Museum, Houston; Tate Britain, London; The Walther
                                Collection, NYC and Germany; Krannert Museum, Illinois, Prospect 4 in New Orleans and as part of

                                Table Manners (2019) is a continuation of the ongoing video series that sees individuals in the Niger

                            <p class="extra-text">Table Manners: Bush Tales #1 is a meditation on the power of folktales on our collective psyche and on
                                how we metabolise morals and ideas. The work is a continuation of the Table Manners series of works
                                that addresses issues of land, ritual, ownership and geography through recorded video eating
                                performances. The first series saw 8 eaters consuming a prepared meal with their hands. Table Manners
                                cites the name of the eater and the place in which the eating performance occurred and we have a sense
                                that the food that is being consumed has a human hand and mind over it. It is a specially-prepared,
                                human-authored meal. In Bush Tales there is no such specificity. The eater is not named and not clothed,
                                he is only man. The tortoise is not part of a prepared dish. Although cooked it is just a tortoise. Not part of
                                a soup and not part of a man-made, inspired dish featuring other elements. It is the meeting of man and
                                animal. Bush Tales moves away from specific cultural readings and matters geographical and rather
                                focuses on the cosmological. The eating performance in this case does something else. It acts as a
                                meditation on ecopsychologies and the psychic relationship between man and beast.
                                Tortoises have an important role in mythologies around the world, and are often implicated in creation
                                myths regarding the origin of the Earth. If the first Table Manners series is about land this next one is
                                about cosmos and our psychic place in the world. Spiritual geography. The mythological idea of the world
                                supported on the back of a tortoise which is itself standing on the back of a tortoise which is also on the
                                back of another tortoise and so on (turtles all the way down or infinite regress, the unknowability of the
                                origins of the earth) appears all over the world. This idea is alluded to in the structure of this installation:
                                three monitors stacked on top of one another. Time plays out mysteriously in each monitor. Simultaneity
                                at some moments moving undetected into non-regimented performances across the three screens. Time
                                is at once constant and inconstant. The integrity of the body and the self also comes into question in parts
                                of this video. In the “second Act” we see surrealist influences at play suggesting a self that plays out
                                differently across different realms and dimensions. Do simultaneous realms co-exist with our own? Do
                                they ever interact? How does time move in these realms? Who are we in these dimensions?
                                
                                Where Table Manners invites viewers to be seated and participate in the consumption of the meal, there
                                is no invitation apparent in the tiered tortoise installation which requires a little distance to view it in its
                                entirety. Indeed there is a sense of transgression in the consumption of the tortoise. This may be, in part,
                                to do with the fact that in many parts of the world tortoises have completely receded from the modern
                                culinary lexicon. In Ogoniland the tortoise occupies a very important place in traditional folklore and
                                tortoises are, for the most part, left alone and are not harmed. So across cultures this piece may be
                                viewed as transgressive. However, tortoises have been and in some instances continue to be consumed
                                in the United States, Asia, all around the world. Turtles only dropped off as a popular menu item because
                                of dwindling stocks of tortoises due to its popularity in the mid 20th century (at least in America) and the
                                length of time it takes for turtle populations to replenish. In the Niger Delta too it is becoming rarer to find
                                them in the wild. But you can occasionally find tortoises for consumption in small corners of market
                                places. However, like a lot of “bush meat” it is not eaten frequently as it is expensive and, as mentioned,
                                not customarily eaten - at least not by Ogoni people.
                                The tortoise is a figure that comes up consistently in Ogoni, Nigerian and West African folk tales. In fact it
                                is safe to say that most folk tales revolve around the tortoise. Globally, turtles are frequently depicted in
                                popular culture as easygoing, patient and wise creatures. Due to their long lifespan, slow movement,
                                sturdiness, and wrinkled appearance, they are an emblem of longevity, stability, steadfastness and
                                tranquility around the world. But Nigerians see something else: the tortoise is a trickster. The tortoise
                                appears nimble and agile. Wily. A wise but devious creature. He is cunning. He is never satisfied. In the
                                stories we find him frequently complaining, securing assistance from a hapless fellow animal to solve a
                                problem, then cheating those who have assisted him. He sometimes gets away with his crime.
                                
                                Sometimes he does not. The tortoise trickster has been problematic and of great fascination to Zina Saro-
                                Wiwa. She states: “I’ve long struggled with tortoise trickster stories. Reading them, dealing with the
                                
                                jagged, discomfiting, disjointed, morally ambiguous nature of them. They are at once unsophisticated and
                                altogether much too sophisticated. They collide adulthood and childhood. Animal and man. Justice and
                                injustice. They marginalize women. What does it that mean that this animal is imbued with these
                                characteristics in this culture? Why did we pick up on these characteristics? What does it mean to have
                                such unforgiving stories at ones core? Are these core stories impacting the way we metabolize and deal
                                with corruption? Does it affect gender relations in some silent way?”
                                The ritualistic enactment of this eating taboo is Saro-Wiwa's way of staging an intervention into the power
                                of tortoise myths. Saro-Wiwa’s work often challenges rituals especially patriarchal ones. The tortoise is a
                                trickster that many times gets away with murder, rape or theft. On the surface the act of man consuming
                                tortoise is in some ways about the attempt to disappear the ideas. However eating is not destroying. The
                                act of consuming the tortoise also represents reconstitution. This is because we metabolise them and in
                                some ways become one with the animal. Bush Tales explores the nature of consumption and encourages
                                us to ask the question: “what is eating and what does eating do?” it also infers “what does not eating do?”
                                By eating and apparently disappearing the tortoise, the animal looms larger than ever before. Living on
                                within the eater and the mind of the viewer. Not just physical but also psychic transfer. In Ogoni folktales,
                                the tortoise is talked of as if he were a man. When reading the stories there is a kind of shapeshifting
                                going on as the tortoise takes on physically human capabilities then the very next moment is at the mercy
                                of his tortoise biology. They swap characteristics and embody one another. Man is tortoise, tortoise is
                                man. This video piece responds to this aspect of existential transmogrification in folkloric storytelling.
                                The text that appears in the video are intended to be ingested also. They are core ideas and tropes that
                                
                                emerge from multiple Ogoni folktales. The ecopsychology of the tortoise is of great importance to Saro-
                                Wiwa and fits into her investigation into the relationship between self and environment as well as
                                
                                emotional landscapes. Emotion is addressed in the text, reflecting the varied emotional states
                                demonstrated by the animals in the folktales and the complex feelings Zina had when making this piece.
                                Bush Tales is of the Table Manners family but is a more emotional piece than the original series. In many
                                ways Bush Tales is a work about grief. Grief at storytelling. Grief at death. Grief at impunity. It is about the
                                lack of mercy in the world. It is an act of mourning.
